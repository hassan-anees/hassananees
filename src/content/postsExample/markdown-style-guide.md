Here is a sample of some basic Markdown syntax that can be used when writing Markdown content in Astro.

From October 4th to October 22nd, I completed a fantasy I’ve had for three years. I say fantasy because, at one point, I thought it would never happen. But, once I started riding motorcycles again in 2018 in CA, the dream of riding cross-country lit in my adventure soul. So now I can proudly say I rode my Yamaha Tenere 700 motorcycle on a 19-day 3795-mile solo cross-country adventure through eight states. The journey started from my home in San Francisco, CA, to my parents’ house in Teachey, NC, where I grew up. To have completed this journey feels more than a box checked on my life goals and more like a kickstarter to my confidence and the next phase in my life, which I feel like I’m still figuring out. Still, I’m happy to have that box checked!

Overall, the adventure went way smoother than I could have ever imagined — no problems with the bike, police, other humans, or even the weather. I wish the same could be said for my body as my sciatic nerve pain went from 0 to 100 while on the ride. Wait, one problem with the weather was riding through extreme wind gusts. I’ll explain later below…

#### How do I feel about depression?

I hate depression. I hate it with my soul. I despise how depression can make me feel. It’s a feeling of hopelessness, sadness, and loss of all confidence. Depression makes me feel as if I don’t matter, I’m not good enough, and I have no voice. Combine depression with imposter syndrome, with being an introvert with episodes of anxiety, and you have a perfect mix of a mental volcano that could remain calm for years, or you never know when or what could trigger it to explode. My thoughts could be as unstable as the climate unless I work on it daily. It’s a war with myself, and it’s a war with my brain to maintain a sense of hope and stability. So yeah, I f**\***g hate depression!

The Back Story: What Caused My Depression, This time?
It’s been ten years since I first came to Silicon Valley before moving to San Francisco. S.F. is now home. I came to Silicon Valley with…
