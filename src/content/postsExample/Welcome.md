This is your new *vault*.

Make a note of something, [[create a link]], or try [the Importer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Importer)!

When you're ready, delete this note and make the vault your own.

When i am creating this piece of content I am not thinking about the consequences of this. It is a simple thing really, to showcase this work and demonstrate t *how are i become this* 

When I am doing some new stuff i create a new piece of content

```
function helloWorld(){
	console.log("Hello world")
}
```
