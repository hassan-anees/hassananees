I suck at writing, and you probably do too. I avoided English class like the plague when growing up. It wasn't until years later that I understood that spoken and written language is the most powerful skill.  

I built this platform to practice my writing. I've tried blogging in the past but suffered from perfectionism. I'll try again because it's worth it. To you who's stumbled here by chance, hello. I'm Hassan, and you can learn more about me [here](https://hassananees.com/#about).
