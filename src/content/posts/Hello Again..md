I suck at writing. I avoided English class like the plague when growing up. Years later I understood its importance. I built this platform to practice my writing. I've tried blogging in the past but suffered from perfectionism. I'll try again because it's worth it. To you who's stumbled here by chance, hello. I'm Hassan, and you can learn more about me [here](https://hassananees.com/#about).
