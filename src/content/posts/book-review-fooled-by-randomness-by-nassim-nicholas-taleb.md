The quote above was the source of inspiration for this write-up. I write not only to express what a fantastic book Fooled by Randomness is, but to reflect on the areas of the book the influenced my thinking the most.

Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a fascinating book which I highly recommend for those interested in understanding hidden risk, misinterpretations of probability, and how randomness is nested in everything we do.

While the book focuses on the role of randomness in the financial market, it covers high-level principles rooted in statistics, probability, and psychology which help apply the main takeaways across a multitude of domains.

I've been stuck rethinking about this quote.
