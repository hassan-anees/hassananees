Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a fascinating book which I highly recommend for those interested in understanding hidden risk, misinterpretations of probability, and how randomness is nested in everything we do.

While the book focuses on the role of randomness in the financial market, it covers high-level principles rooted in statistics, probability, and psychology which help apply the main takeaways across a multitude of domains.
