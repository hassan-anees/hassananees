> Nicholas Nassim Taleb, **Fooled by Randomness**

The quote above was the source of inspiration for this write-up. I write not only to express what a fantastic book Fooled by Randomness is, but to reflect on the areas of the book the influenced my thinking the most.

### Making an Impression

Most of us were taught to not leave a bad impression on others. We were taught to be polite and careful when articulating our thoughts. This behavior is evident all relationships (familial, business, political).

> From the standpoint of an institution, the existence of a risk manager has less to do with actual risk reduction than it has to do with the impression of risk reduction.

Most people are hell-bent on making a good impression and do everything to avoid making a bad one. We were taught this from a young age and regardless of whether the action taken to make an impression is rooted in truth. This behavior is evident in all relationships, whether it is personal, business, or political.

You can see this carried out by governments on a large-scale as they usually prioritize visible measures over effective ones. Ross Anderson illustrates this well in his book Security Engineering. A notable example from him being the distribution of funding by the TSA on security. TSA has spend billions on passenger screening which is quite ineffective while $100m spent on reinforcing cockpit doors mitigated majority of risks.

Everything is carried out by emotions. Actions are carried out by emotions

Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a fascinating book which I highly recommend for those interested in understanding hidden risk, misinterpretations of probability, and how randomness is nested in everything we do.

While the book focuses on the role of randomness in the financial market, it covers high-level principles rooted in statistics, probability, and psychology which help apply the main takeaways across a multitude of domains.

I've been stuck rethinking about this quote.

> I start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative

I start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative
