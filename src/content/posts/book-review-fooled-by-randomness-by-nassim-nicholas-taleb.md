I write to express what a fantastic book Fooled by Randomness is and to reflect on the areas of the book the influenced my thinking the most. We'll talk about the following:

1.  Our brains suck at **nonlinear** thinking
    
2.  Why we choose to make good **impressions** over meaningful impact
    
3.  How the real signal reveals itself among the noise via **ergodicity**
    

Many of the topics Nassim Taleb writes pertains to the role randomness plays in financial markets. You learn plenty on common misunderstandings when it comes to statistics and probability. However, to my surprise, many of the arguments made in the book are deeply rooted in timeless principles of human behavior.

### Our Brains Suck at Nonlinear Thinking

Your brain has a difficult time understanding nonlinear outcomes. Your emotional circuitry is built to understand linear outputs. Meaning if **x** causes **y** and if I increase **x**, then **y** will **always** increase **x**.

For example, the more time I practice painting, the better my paintings will become. However, I could spend months painting and not a single one of my paintings could show any improvement during that time. We often expect a **linear** **outcome**. Meaning that if you practice consistently, you will consistently get better. Nassim Taleb states that we rarely see satisfying **linear outcomes** in reality.

However, let's say that I have the mental toughness to continue despite no visible results. At the 6th month I have a "aha" moment and I am suddenly able to paint like Bob Ross. This is known as the **tipping** **point** or a **nonlinear outcome**. We see this all throughout nature as well. An ice cube will not melt at 29°F, 30°F, or 31°F, but at 32°F (0°C).

Nonlinear outcomes are difficult to comprehend because small changes can lead to disproportionate results. We like linear outcomes because of their predictable nature and ease of understanding. Anything that is easier to understand is using **availability bias**. A natural human tendency to over weigh the importance of information that comes to us more easily.

In similar fashion, Nassim Taleb says many people both undervalue and misunderstand nonlinear outcomes. This leads us either blindly ignoring rare events or being ill prepared for them.

### Making an Impression

Nassim Taleb focuses on rare events and its relationship to prob

Most people are hell-bent on making a good impression and do everything to avoid making a bad one. This behavior is visible in all relationships, whether it is personal, business, or political.

Within the realm of business, Nassim Taleb hammers against the role of the modern day risk manager within large financial institutions throughout the book.

> From the standpoint of an institution, the existence of a risk manager has less to do with actual risk reduction than it has to do with the impression of risk reduction.

Unfortunately, this type of behavior is carried through many industries.

Within the field of cybersecurity, we typically see this as "security theater" which means to implement measures that evoke a feeling of security without actually improving security. You can see this carried out by governments on a large-scale as they usually prioritize visible measures over effective ones.

Ross Anderson illustrates this well in his book Security Engineering on the measures taken post 9/11. A notable example being the distribution of security funding by the TSA. The TSA could have reduced most of their risk of hijackers by spending $100m on reinforcing cockpit doors. Instead, to demonstrate a visible measure, they spent the majority of their budget (around 14.7 billion) on passenger screening \[^1\].

There are many reasons for prioritizing

The term was coined by Bruce Schneier his book Beyond Fear.

This might seem odd, but we can see patterns of this behavior all over. Its driven from incentives. Incentive based motivation

While the book concentrates on the financial industry, the underlying principles can be rooted to many domains.

> From the standpoint of an institution, the existence of a risk manager has less to do with actual risk reduction than it has to do with the impression of risk reduction.

Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a fascinating book which I highly recommend for those interested in understanding hidden risk, misinterpretations of probability, and how randomness is nested in everything we do.

While the book focuses on the role of randomness in the financial market, it covers high-level principles rooted in statistics, probability, and psychology which help apply the main takeaways across many domains.

### Resonating Quotes

> I start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the results, but by the costs of the alternative
> 
> Nicholas Nassim Taleb, **Fooled by Randomness**

**Backups**

Most people are hell-bent on making a good impression and do everything to avoid making a bad one. We were taught this from a young age and regardless of whether the action taken to make an impression is rooted in truth. This behavior is visible in all relationships, whether it is personal, business, or political.

### Further Reading

*   I recommend reading Malcolm Gladwell's **The Tipping Point** if you keen to learn about fun case studies.
