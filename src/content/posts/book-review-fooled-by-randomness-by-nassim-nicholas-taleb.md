The quote above was the inspiration for this write-up. I write to express what a fantastic book Fooled by Randomness is and to reflect on the areas of the book the influenced my thinking the most. I'll walk through the following:

*   Your brain sucks at understanding nonlinearities
    
*   Making an impression
    
*   Everything is noise until it isn't - **ergodicity**
    

### Your Brain isn't Built for Nonlinearities

Your brain has a difficult time understanding nonlinear outcomes. Your emotional circuitry is built to understand linear outputs. Meaning if **x** causes **y** and if I increase **x**, then **y** will **always** increase **x**.

For example, the more time I practice painting, the better my paintings will become. However, I could spent months learning to paint and not a single one of my paintings could show any improvement during that time. We often expect a **linear** **outcome**. That if you practice consistently, you will consistently get better. Nassime Taleb states that we rarely see a satisfying **linear outcome** in reality.

However, let's say that I have the mental toughness to continue on despite no visible results. At the 6th month I have a "aha" moment and I am suddenly able to paint like Bob Ross. This is known as the **_tipping_** **_point_** famously coined by Malcolm Gladwell. More importantly This is also seen as a nonlinear outcome

This happens more frequently than we imagine and is captured well in Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point.

The same applies to any domain. However, there

From the outside it might seem a waste of time, but at some point I may come to understand the type

Taleb illustrates this example with studying, For example, when it comes to studying, the more we study, the more in proportion.

Our brain does a bad job understanding nonlinear outcomes. What I mean by nonlinear outcomes is having

What I mean by non-linear outcomes are A basic example of non-linear outcomes is the result of compound interest.

### Making an Impression

Most people are hell-bent on making a good impression and do everything to avoid making a bad one. We were taught this from a young age and regardless of whether the action taken to make an impression is rooted in truth. This behavior is visible in all relationships, whether it is personal, business, or political.

Within the realm of business, Nassim Taleb hammers against the role of the modern day risk manager within large financial institutions throughout the book. He stresses that their role has more to do with an impression of reducing risk than actual risk reduction. Unfortunately, this type of behavior is carried through many industries.

Within my field of cybersecurity, we typically see this as "security theater" which means to implement measures that evoke a feeling of security without actually improving security. You can see this carried out by governments on a large-scale as they usually prioritize visible measures over effective ones. Ross Anderson illustrates this well in his book Security Engineering on the measures taken post 9/11. A notable example from the book is the distribution of security funding by the TSA. The TSA could have reduced most of their risk of hijackers by spending $100m on reinforcing cockpit doors. Instead, to demonstrate a visible measure, they spent the majority of their budget (around 14.7 billion) on passenger screening \[^1\].

The term was coined by Bruce Schneier his book Beyond Fear.

This might seem odd, but we can see patterns of this behavior

While the book concentrates on the financial industry, the underlying principles can be rooted to many domains.

> From the standpoint of an institution, the existence of a risk manager has less to do with actual risk reduction than it has to do with the impression of risk reduction.

TSA has spend billions on passenger screening which is quite ineffective while $100m spent on reinforcing cockpit doors mitigated majority of risks.

Everything is carried out by emotions. Actions are carried out by emotions

Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a fascinating book which I highly recommend for those interested in understanding hidden risk, misinterpretations of probability, and how randomness is nested in everything we do.

While the book focuses on the role of randomness in the financial market, it covers high-level principles rooted in statistics, probability, and psychology which help apply the main takeaways across many domains.
